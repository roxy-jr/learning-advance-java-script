        <p align="center" id=" lojpa"> thus method is used to write arbitrary html and content in to page.<br>
        if we use this function after an html document is fully loaded,with deleteall properties.it used only for testing purpose</p>
        <h2 align="center">Now we look for writeln( ) method</h2>
        <p align=" center" id="sds"> the writeln method is same as above wiith addition of writing a new line character after each statements</p>
        <script>
            document.write(" heloo adi "); // here we not put a line break so,
            document.write("HI anmol");// both statements are seem to be in same line.
            document.write("<br>"+ "NOW LOOK HERE"+"<br>");
            document.writeln("hello adi"+"<br>"); // an automated line break method is writln() method so,
            document.writeln("HI anmol");// both statements are seem to be in new line
        </script>
